## Implement "Extensible Records with Scoped Labels" ##
- Add in record syntax / projections (types are required here, and expanded system of values)

## Make a concrete syntax for the lambda calculus, so that I can parse it. ##
- So I now have a concrete, but very limited syntax for the lambda calculus, and I can parse programs!! (DONE)
- fold application to the left (DONE)

## Have the interpreter interpret line-by-line ##
- This decision actually requires a lot more thought
- What am I making?

# Port to OCaml, or some strict language. # 
## Do I want to port to C? ##
